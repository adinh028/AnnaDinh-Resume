        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Anna Dinh and I currently attend the  University of California, Riverside as a Pre-Business major. My concentration is focused on marketing. My main interests include photography and videography, which are both main components of advertising for a number of companies. In my second or third year of university, I am hoping to obtain an internship within a social media, advertising company, ones similar to Jubilee or Buzzfeed.<br><br>

        
A fun fact about me is that I am bilingual; I know both English and Vietnamese. I also have very strong time management and organizational skills, as a large sum of my peers have pointed out to me. I make sure that my work space is tidy as it allows me to organize my thoughts and use time more efficiently. I got into videography when I was about eight years old in Elementary school; I remember watching videos from multiple creators and wishing that I too could indulge in such an activity. One day, out of the ordinary, I decided to do just that. I watched a number of tutorials and downloaded different software for myself to get familiar with and practice on. From that point on, I had made video editing a main hobby of mine. On the other hand, photography, I had gotten into it a little bit later. My freshman year of High School, I took a photography class that then sparked my interest in photography as a whole; I enjoyed learning about the functions of a digital camera and how to use Photoshop to its fullest potential. I learned about capabilities I was not familiar with before, despite all the online tutorials I had watched. Taking photography was an eye-opening experience for my high school career and definitely kickstarted the beginning of my interest in marketing altogether.
<br><br>

        Although I may lack experience in the professional field regarding business marketing, I do have experience with softwares such as Sony Vegas Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Photoshop. As of right now, I am currently employed at a very mainstream, popular tea shop called Tasteas. My intention is to work my way up and to be promoted to supervisor so that I can learn more about managing a business and use my following knowledge for future references. I started the job in the Summer; because of COVID-19 and being unable to dorm or move up to Riverside, I had decided to make use of my time in my hometown, while I am still living in it. I soon found myself applying to a number of different jobs and upon interviewing at Tasteas, I was offered a position the following night and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. I strongly believe that obtaining a job during university is very beneficial as it allows you to work on your strength and weaknesses as you pursue your major and begin looking for internships; it provides you with the experience needed to apply to any internship at any firm or company.
